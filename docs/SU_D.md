# Download the tutorial data

The last thing to do is to download the tutorial data. As with the install script, open Firefox, navigate to [this page](SU_D.md) and download the [tutorial data](http://gofile.me/5dTaz/8tQZNApgN). 

The only thing to do now is to unzip the tutorial data in your home directory. If you didn't change the Firefox setting you will first have to copy the data to your home directory and then unzip it. To do so first change into your home directory, then copy the downloaded file here and then unzip it:

    # change into home directory
    cd

    # copy the file into your home
    cp ~/Downloads/course_data.zip ./

    # unzip the directory

    unzip course_data.zip

**Congratulations, you are done with the configuration and are ready to start the tutorials!**
